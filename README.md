# Links
 - Use [Automated Build Steps](https://01.org/intel-secl/documentation/build-installation-scripts) to build all repositories in one go, this will also provide provision to install prerequisites and would handle order and version of dependent repositories.

***Note:** Automated script would install a specific version of the build tools, which might be different than the one you are currently using*
